"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell\n"
"(North-Western Victoria, Australia) told William Stanbridge something of their\n"
"stories relating to the night sky. Some forty stars, constellations and other\n"
"celestial phenomena were named and located. He wrote them down and related this\n"
"information to the Philosophical Institute in Melbourne in 1857. In his paper\n"
"he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European equivalent.\n"
"\n"
"What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial phenomena,\n"
"attempt to satisfactorily identity them and to imitate the way the Boorong\n"
"people may have seen them. John's interpretation was used to create the\n"
"constellation figures in Stellarium."
msgstr ""
"一百四十年前，泰瑞尔湖（澳大利亚西北维多利亚）的一个Boorong家庭告诉威廉·斯坦布里奇，他们有关夜空的故事。命名并定位了约40个恒星，星座和其他天体现象。他写下了这些文字，并将此信息与墨尔本的哲学研究所相关联。1857年，他在论文中写下了“原住民”一词，并给出了与欧洲相同的词。\n"
"\n"
"约翰·莫里森（John Morieson）所做的事情是仔细观察这些天体现象，以令人满意的方式识别它们，并模仿布隆人可能看到它们的方式。 John的解释被用于在Stellarium中创建星座图。"
