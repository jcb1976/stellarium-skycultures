# Sky culture description section in markdown format
msgid ""
"One hundred and forty years ago, a Boorong family at Lake Tyrrell\n"
"(North-Western Victoria, Australia) told William Stanbridge something of their\n"
"stories relating to the night sky. Some forty stars, constellations and other\n"
"celestial phenomena were named and located. He wrote them down and related this\n"
"information to the Philosophical Institute in Melbourne in 1857. In his paper\n"
"he wrote down the Aboriginal term and gave its European equivalent.\n"
"\n"
"What John Morieson has done is look closely at these celestial phenomena,\n"
"attempt to satisfactorily identity them and to imitate the way the Boorong\n"
"people may have seen them. John's interpretation was used to create the\n"
"constellation figures in Stellarium."
